  \brief Stopwatch application.
   
  This is a simple stop watch, which begins counting as the + key is
  hit and clears the count when the 0 key is pressed.  Because the
  RTC is busy with the real time, we count in quarter seconds as the
  display is updated.
  
  Hold the / key to briefly show the time of day without leaving the
  stopwatch or abandoning the count.

  We do not count time or store the count when in other applications.
  It would be nice to change that, so that something could be timed in
  the background while the user is doing other things.

/* It's a crying shame, but you'll break the code if you increase this
   count to a long, because repeated divisions in rendering will take
   longer than the ~8k cycles we have per interrupt when running at
   32kHz and the stopwatch will run too slow.

   To work around this, we maintain the count of hours separately from
   the general second count.
